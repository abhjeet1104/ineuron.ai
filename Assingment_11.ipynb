For example, you can configure your logging system to send all error messages to a file, while sending all debug messages to the console.

        "\n",
        "Logging libraries often have built-in support for handling different levels of logging, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. This allows you to control the verbosity of your logs, making it easy to see only the information that is relevant to your needs.\n",
